[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmotion_capture_tracking_interfaces.cmake" in
  CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked CMake to find a package
  configuration file provided by "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    motion_capture_tracking_interfacesConfig.cmake
    motion_capture_tracking_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces_DIR" to a
  directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "motion_capture_tracking_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
